# Context and goal

I have done this application for a school project and wanted to try to do a mobile app in using web technologies I am familiar with. Having none mobile background, it was a leap in the dark but in the same time it was really exciting.

This app is made to be simple and may help people knowing React & Redux to get into creating mobile apps. It's made with React Native, coupled with some extra nice packages to handle routing, dataflow and UI elements.
